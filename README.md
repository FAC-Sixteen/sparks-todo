# Week 2 Project To Do App

## 👩‍🔧 Team: 
Anna @aniablaziak

Kate @dubhcait

Bobby @bobbysebolao

## 🏌️‍♂️ Our goals: 
- mobile first design from the start
- accessible design 
- two sets of buttons (one smaller on top, one bolder below) for adding a new todo and switching the order 
- optimizing the app to be dyslexia-friendly

### 🏋️‍♀️ Some stretch goals:
- function for the switch button
- editing the todos
- adding CSS animations 

## 👷‍♀️ Built with: 
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Node packages: tape, tap-spec, istanbul, nodemon
* skeleton folder from FAC
* Figma for design

## 🌊 Our workflow:
- First work on JavaScript and testing (programming together in a team of three)

## 🔬 Testing: 

## 🖍 Design:
- each todo is large and clearly separated from the others 
- different styling on completed todos 

## 🤷‍♂️ Issuses and what we struggled with: 
- starting the project with JavaScript (instead of HTML and styling)
- working on the code provided instead of starting a project from scratch 
- working on functions first rather than working on the tests
- not knowing about equal vs deepEqual

## 🧗‍♂️ What we've learned:
